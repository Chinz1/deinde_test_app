# flutter_engineer_ui_translation_test

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Here are a few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

To run the app, just download the APK file and unzip the APK file. Then you open the unzipped file in your VS Code. Then run flutter pub get and then run the code.
Also, I was not able to complete the test for the mobile app because I currently work for a company so I was given several tasks by the company that I work for so I did not have enough time to complete the 
test for the mobile app.
